      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm an undergraduate in Concordia University's computational arts (specialization) program.</p>
      <p>I chose this program because I'm interested in the digital age along with its contributions to art, communication and knowledge.</p>
      <p>Through these studies, I hope to acquire the skills and knowledge to be able to create and work on computer graphics within the field of motion-capture for both video-games and film.</p>
      <p>I've always had an affinity for these types of media but recently I've noticed that they've started to merge thanks to tech such as motion-capture, which is fascinating and exciting.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I'm interested in all sorts of things ranging from reality-TV to the colonization of Mars.</p>
      <p>Finally, If I had to form a team of reality-TV personalities it would have to include: Tiffany Pollard, Kim Kardashian and Abby Lee Miller.</p>
